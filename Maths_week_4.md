# Week 4

> Discussion Topics

1. University/mathematics
2. General topics

## University/mathematics

1. Definitions
2. Proofs

### Definitions

- "formal definitions" as in other sciences (you give the class the object belongs to and some defining properties)
- "axiomatic definitions" (you assume defining properties, but don't actually say what class the object belongs to)

### Proofs

- **direct proofs** (take definitions and axioms and lead them to the conclusion)
- proof by **complete induction** (prove the theorem for a smallest natural number and then show that if it works for a number, it also works for the next)

- **indirect proof** (assume the opposite of what you want to show and lead that to a contradiction)
- *proof techniques*: extremal principle (assume that there is a biggest or smallest object and look at its properties)

## General Topics
### Mathematics in film/books/series
